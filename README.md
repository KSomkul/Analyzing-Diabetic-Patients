# Predicting Glucose Monitoring Method Conversion

## Project Overview

A diabetes supply company is an outpatient facility that primarily delivers diabetic supplies to patients across the United States. Currently, the company has recently acquired the Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) product.

National University’s Master of Data Science Students were asked by the company to build a predictive model to identify prospective patients who would be likely to convert from the traditional finger-pricking method for their glucose monitoring to the continuous glucose method – specifically to the Freestyle Libre. 

## Data

This data contained socio-economic, demographic and clinical information from 45,000 U.S. diabetic patients of a diabetes supply company in year 2019.
