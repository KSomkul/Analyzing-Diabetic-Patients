## Predicting Glucose Monitoring Method Conversion

###The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between the type of referral a patient receives and the likelihood that the patient will convert to the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) method from the traditional (SMBG) method while controlling for a number of demographic variables and clinical variables using a diabetic supply companyâ€™s data from 2019. 

###The statistical methods used were: t-tests and chi-square tests of association for unadjusted bivariate analyses and a few predictive models, including logistic regression, for an adjusted multivariable analysis. 

###The results revealed that referral type was the most influential variable in the conversion rate of patients to the CGM method, along with age, region, gender, and insurance. Understanding the characteristics of a patient that is likely to convert can pave the way for researchers and stakeholders to change current administration in the U.S. in order to make CGM the regular form of glucose monitoring.
